Delta is an iOS application that allows you to emulate and play video games for several classic video game systems, including Game Boy Advance, Nintendo 64, and Nintendo DS. Delta is the spiritual successor to [GBA4iOS](http://www.gba4iosapp.com) ‚Äî a Game Boy Advance emulator for iOS devices [Paul Thorsen](https://twitter.com/pau1thor) and I made while in high school together ‚Äî rebuilt from the ground up with modern iOS features and support for more systems.

## Installation

Download Delta from the Apple App Store.

[<img src="https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta/assets/48800753/a9eaf6a7-8e2c-4e4b-b8aa-7c5feed8decc">](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688)

### Sideloading

Delta was originally developed under the impression Apple would allow it into the App Store (which it now is). For a long time, Apple wouldn't allow it on the app store, leaving me no choice but to find a new way to distribute Delta. Long story short, this led me to create [AltStore](https://github.com/rileytestut/AltStore), which now serves as the official way to install Delta onto your device.

To install Delta with AltStore:
1. Download AltServer for Mac or PC from https://altstore.io
2. Connect your iOS device to your computer via lightning cable (or USB-C for iPads).
3. [Follow these instructions](https://altstore.io/faq/) to install AltStore onto your device with AltServer.
2. Open AltStore on your device, then navigate to the "Browse" tab.
3. Find Delta, then press the `FREE` button to start installing the app.

Once you've installed Delta with AltStore, **you'll need to refresh it at least once every 7 days to prevent it from expiring** and requiring a re-installation. AltStore will periodically attempt to refresh your apps in the background when on the same WiFi as AltServer, but you can also manually refresh apps by pressing "Refresh All" in AltStore. AltStore will also let you know whenever a new update is released, allowing you to update Delta directly within AltStore.

Alternatively, you are welcome to download the compiled `.ipa`'s from [Releases](https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta/releases) and sideload them using whatever sideloading method you prefer, but you will not receive automatic updates and will have to manually update Delta by re-sideloading each new version.

## Project Overview

Delta was designed from the beginning to be modular, and for that reason each "Delta Core" has its own GitHub repo and is added as a submodule to the main Delta project. Additionally, Delta uses two of my own private frameworks I use to share common functionality between my apps: Roxas and Harmony.

[**Delta**](https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta)  
Delta is just a regular, sandboxed iOS application. The Delta app repo (aka this one) contains all the code specific to the Delta app itself, such as storyboards, app-specific view controllers, database logic, etc.

[**DeltaCore**](https://github.com/rileytestut/DeltaCore)  
DeltaCore serves as the ‚Äúmiddle-man‚Äù between the high-level app code and the specific emulation cores. By working with this framework, you have access to all the core Delta features, such as emulation, controller skins, save states, cheat codes, etc. Other potential emulator apps will use this framework extensively.

[**Roxas**](https://github.com/rileytestut/Roxas)    
Roxas is my own framework used across my projects, developed to simplify a variety of common tasks used in iOS development.

[**Harmony**](https://github.com/rileytestut/Harmony)   
Harmony is my personal syncing framework designed to sync Core Data databases. Harmony listens for changes to an app's persistent store, then syncs any changes with a remote file service (such as Google Drive or Dropbox).

**Delta Cores**  
Each system in Delta is implemented as its own "Delta Core", which serves as a standard emulation API Delta can understand regardless of the underlying core. For the most part, you don't interact directly with specific Delta Cores, but rather indirectly through `DeltaCore`.
- [NESDeltaCore](https://github.com/rileytestut/NESDeltaCore)
- [SNESDeltaCore](https://github.com/rileytestut/SNESDeltaCore)
- [N64DeltaCore](https://github.com/rileytestut/N64DeltaCore)
- [GBCDeltaCore](https://github.com/rileytestut/GBCDeltaCore)
- [GBADeltaCore](https://github.com/rileytestut/GBADeltaCore)
- [MelonDSDeltaCore](https://github.com/rileytestut/MelonDSDeltaCore)
- [GPGXDeltaCore](https://github.com/rileytestut/GPGXDeltaCore)

## Minimum Project Requirements
- Xcode 15
- Swift 5.9
- iOS 14.0

## Compilation Instructions

> Delta uses Git LFS to manage large files, so first make sure you have [installed Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com).

1. Clone this repository by running the following command in Terminal*  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta.git
```  

2. Update Git submodules
```bash
$ cd Delta
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```  

3. Open `Systems/Systems.xcworkspace` and select the "Systems" project in the project navigator (a.k.a. the left sidebar).
4. Select "Systems" under `Targets`, then click the `Signing & Capabilities` tab.
5. Change `Team` from "Yvette Testut" to your own account.
6. Close `Systems/Systems.xcworkspace`, then open `Delta.xcworkspace`.
6. Repeat steps 4 & 5 with the "Delta" target.
7. Change Delta's `Bundle Identifier` to something unique, such as by appending your GitHub username (ex: `com.rileytestut.Delta.MyGitHubUsername`).
8. Build + run app! üéâ


\* This will checkout the `main` branch by default, which is kept up-to-date with the latest public version. Ongoing development (including [Patreon betas](https://www.patreon.com/rileytestut)) is done on the `develop` branch, and is periodically merged into `main` whenever a new public version is released. If you'd prefer to compile the `develop` version instead, replace the `git clone` command in Step #1 with this one:
```bash
$ git clone -b develop https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta.git
```  

## Licensing
Due to the licensing of emulator cores used by Delta, I have no choice but to distribute Delta under the **AGPLv3 license**. That being said, I explicitly give permission for anyone to use, modify, and distribute all *my* original code for this project in any form, with or without attribution, without fear of legal consequences ‚Äî unless you plan to submit your app to Apple‚Äôs App Store, in which case written permission from me is explicitly required. Dependencies remain under their original licenses.
